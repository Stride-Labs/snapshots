# Airdrops for stToken Holders
Users liquid stake with Stride expecting to be eligible for airdrops to TIA, ATOM, OSMO, and more.

Stride regularly uploads snapshots of all stTIA, stATOM, and stOSMO holders to make it simple for projects to airdrop to these tokens. 

### Snapshot data

Regular stToken snapshots will be uploaded to this repository beginning the week of Feb 5, 2024.

Projects who wish to include stToken holders in their airdrops can download their desired snapshot.

### Why Airdrop to stToken Holders?

1) stToken holders are the power users of the Cosmos Ecosystem, demonstrating a willingness to experiment with new technologies and DeFi applications.

2) More than 80% of Cosmos LST holders use Stride. Airdropping to staked tokens and excluding stTokens alienates prospective users that would have otherwise qualified.

3) Stride can co-market your launch and help you tap into a vibrant community of on-chain DeFi users.
